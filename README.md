# LRECA

The source codes and a demo are provided to evaluate our LRECA model's ability to discern the phase-separation potential of proteins directly from amino acid (AA) sequences. This demo further scrutinizes the model's explainability by interpreting its predictions, aiming to ascertain the impact of individual amino acids and their sequential patterns on biomolecular condensation regulation. The accompanying code is linked to the paper titled "Discovery of phase separation protein with single amino acid attributions by unbiased deep-learning".

The source codes can be used to train and test the model with 10-fold cross validation on all datasets. However, it will take a lot of time to train the model if you do not have a good GPU. We also provide a demo that includes the trained models and corresponding testing data. The demo can run in a normal computer and will finish in about six minutes.

## Requirement

This code was implemented using the Pytorch framework (version 2.1.1). More details have been described in the file “requirements.txt”.

## Files

Sources codes included three folders, the /RCNN_model, the /Data, and the /RCNN_ECA_saliency. All codes of the demo are included in the fold /Demo.

The folder /RCNN_model contains four files, RCNN_ECA_3_LLPS.py, RCNN_ECA_3_R.py, RCNN_ECA_3_high.py, and RCNN_ECA_3_madata.py, which contain the code for training and testing the model using 10-fold cross validation on the datasets of LLPS and PDB, phaspDB_reviewed and PDB, phaspDB_highthroughput and PDB, and inhouse-dataset and PDB, respectively.

The folder /Data contains the negative data from the PDB database and the positive data from public databases and the in-house dataset (mydata).

The folder /RCNN_ECA_saliency contains the files for computing the contribution of each AA and AA segment. Specifically, /RCNN_ECA_saliency /saliency_function /method /RCNN_ECA_saliency_gradCAM.py contain the code for obtained the contribution of each AA. /RCNN_ECA_saliency /saliency_function /RCNN_ECA_save_model contain the well trained model and corresponding parameters. The folder /RCNN_ECA_saliency /LCRs_process contain the code for identifying the main contributing AA segments in a protein for LLPS based on the results of the contributions of each AA.

The folder /Demo contains five folds. /Demo/trained model contains four trained models for the four datasets. /Demo/test_dataset contains the testing data for the four datasets in the demo. /Demo/code_for_model_testing contains the codes for testing. /Demo/classification_output contains the testing results of the trained models on the testing datasets in the demo. /Demo/ saliency_model contains the trained model used for computing the contribution of each AA and AA segment.

## Model

The architecture of the model is shown in Figure 1. LRECA model consists of four modules, i.e., embedding module, BiLSTMs, ECA module, and classification module. The model receives an input tensor with dimension (N, M), and returns an output tensor with dimension (N, 2), for which N is the batch size and M is the length of AA sequence. Output of the model: shape = (N, 2). The output contains two probabilities of LLPS and non-LLPS, between 0 and 1, and sum to 1.

## Individual AA contribution analysis

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used to analysis the contribution of each AA or AA segment in a protein for LLPS, as shown in Figure 2.
